# Cisco Config Web

Me and my friend  @Questi0nM4rk created this website to help us configure a cisco network. It should be capable of almost everything you could find at our secondary school. Now the website is still used by our teacher as an education material.

It was the first bigger project I ever made and I was still just starting with programming. If i were programming it now, I would definetly use more CSS and decompose the JavaScript code better. This was essentialy the start of my passion towards IT which only grew over the years.
